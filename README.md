Forked from [WebBreacher/obsidian-osint-templates](https://github.com/WebBreacher/obsidian-osint-templates); we made some changes according our needs.

## What is Obsidian?
Instead of me explaining what [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is and how to use it, I suggest you visit [the YouTube channel of Linking Your Thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88&list=PL3NaIVgSlAVLHty1-NuvPa9V0b0UwbzBd) and watch a few of those free videos. Alternatively, [the help section of the Obsidian website](https://help.obsidian.md/Start+here) has detailed documentation that is worth a read.

Both resources walk you through the basics of how Obsidian works and what you can expect in the tool and its files. I strongly urge you to go watch those short videos, read the docs, and take notes.

## Templates
These templates are suggestions of how the Obsidian notetaking tool can be used during an OSINT investigation.  The example data in those files should allow you to make some connections _(see what I did there?)_ between how you record your data during an investigation and some of what the tool can offer FOR FREE!
